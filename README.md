Open3D is an open-source library that supports rapid development of software
that deals with 3D data. The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully selected
data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. The backend is highly
optimized and is set up for parallelization. We welcome contributions from
the open-source community.

[![Ubuntu CI](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/workflows/Ubuntu%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Ubuntu+CI%22)
[![macOS CI](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/workflows/macOS%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/actions?query=workflow%3A%22macOS+CI%22)

**Core features of Open3D include:**

* 3D data structures
* 3D data processing algorithms
* Scene reconstruction
* Surface alignment
* 3D visualization
* Physically based rendering (PBR)
* 3D machine learning support with PyTorch and TensorFlow
* GPU acceleration for core 3D operations
* Available in C++ and Python

For more, please visit the [Open3D documentation](http://www.open3d.org/docs).

## Installation on Jetson

Follow the instruction on [Open3D ARM documentation](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/arm.html) to install the dependency first,
for example:
```
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y apt-utils build-essential git cmake
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-dev python3-pip
sudo apt-get install -y xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libblas-dev liblapack-dev liblapacke-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libsdl2-dev libc++-7-dev libc++abi-7-dev libxi-dev
sudo apt-get install -y clang-7
```

Then we need to change the default cblas.h:
```angular2html
cd /usr/include/aarch64-linux-gnu
sudo ln -sf cblas-netlib.h cblas.h
```

(optional)Then we can update the repository, by the method described by Github: 
[update fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).

Then we clone the directory (shutong's copy)
```angular2html
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ricardodong/Open3D
cd Open3D
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
```

Then we do cmake, go to [shutong_cmake.txt](shutong_cmake.txt), copy and cmake command and run in terminal,
for example:
```angular2html
cmake \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
    -DBUILD_CUDA_MODULE=ON \
    -DBUILD_GUI=ON \
    -DBUILD_TENSORFLOW_OPS=OFF \
    -DBUILD_PYTORCH_OPS=OFF \
    -DBUILD_UNIT_TESTS=ON \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/open3d_install \
    -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$(which python) \
    ..
```

If Failed with CUDA compiler not found, do these first:
```angular2html
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64
export PATH=$PATH:$CUDA_HOME/bin
```

Then we can make: 
```make -j$(nproc)```

Then we can test cpp build:
```angular2html
make tests -j$(nproc)
./bin/tests --gtest_filter="-*Reduce*Sum*"
```

for the current build, we observe an error of not able to transform uint8 to float32:
```angular2html
C++ exception with description 
/home/correct-ai/Open3D/cpp/open3d/t/geometry/Image.cpp:163: 
Conversion from UInt8 to Float32 on device CUDA:0 is not implemented!
```

Then we do the installation (sudo not required!):
```angular2html
make install
```

At last we install python and we can test it:
```angular2html
make install-pip-package -j$(nproc)
python -c "import open3d; print(open3d)"
```

It's done!

## Python quick start

Pre-built pip and conda packages support Ubuntu 18.04+, macOS 10.14+ and
Windows 10 (64-bit) with Python 3.6-3.9.

```bash
# Install Open3D stable release with pip (including in conda virtual environments)
$ pip install open3d

# Test the installation
$ python3 -c "import open3d as o3d; print(o3d)"

```

To get the latest features in Open3D, install the
[development pip package](http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/getting_started.html#development-version-pip).

Open3D-Viewer is a standalone 3D viewer app available on Ubuntu and macOS.
Please stay tuned for Windows. Download Open3D Viewer from the
[release page](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/releases).

## Open3D-ML

<img width="480" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isl-org/Open3D-ML/master/docs/images/getting_started_ml_visualizer.gif">

Open3D-ML is an extension of Open3D for 3D machine learning tasks. It builds on
top of the Open3D core library and extends it with machine learning tools for
3D data processing. To try it out, install Open3D with PyTorch or TensorFlow and check out
[Open3D-ML](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D-ML).
